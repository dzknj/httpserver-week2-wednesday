This is the README file for my basic http server. It gives the current date and time when a request is made to localhost:3000/time, greets a person when request is made to localhost:3000/greet/(user input name) with a one word string, a name in this case that is added to the url after /greet/, and also it takes a name in JSON form and greets it when a POST request is made to localhost:3000/greet/ via. superagent. also, a gulpfile lints and tests the files involved with this basic http server. Also, if any files associated with any gulp task are changed while the gulp process is running, gulp will rerun all tasks automatically.
